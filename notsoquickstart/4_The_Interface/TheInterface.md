### The canvas
The canvas displays your active tree (only once at a time) and active datasets. With the canvas users can :
* change canvas size
* drag the tree around
* zoom in and out the tree
* mouse over tree leaves, nodes and datasets to show additional information in a popup panel
The canvas is featuring WYSIWYG (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get); what you see at the canvas is what you get when you export your plot to external files.
